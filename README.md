## Description
Horiseon is a marketing website and  contains  information about three modules; Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing. 

In this repository, I refactored the source code.

-Made sure that headings fall in sequential order.
-Adjusted broken `link`.
-Changed the `title` element's with more descriptive one.
-Replaced un-semantic tags with proper semantic tags.
-Added `alt` attributes to each image elements.
-Commented CSS file properly.
